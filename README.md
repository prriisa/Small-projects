# Small Projects

This repository contains small frontend projects created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Each project focuses on improving core web development concepts and hands-on practice.

## Projects

### 1. Card Generator
A simple web project that takes user data from a form and generates a personalized card dynamically using JavaScript.

### 2. Email & Password Validator
A simple frontend project that validates email and password inputs based on predefined rules and shows appropriate error or success messages.

### 3. Dark / Light Theme Toggle (OS Aware)
A modern dark–light mode switcher that automatically detects the user’s OS theme and also allows manual theme switching using a toggle button.  

The selected theme is saved in localStorage, and user preference is given priority over system settings.

### 4. Real-Time User Search Filter
A dynamic frontend project that displays user cards and filters them in real time based on the starting letters of the user’s name.  
It uses JavaScript string methods and DOM manipulation to show matching users instantly and displays a **“No User Found”** message when no match exists.

### 5. Call Note Manager
A responsive call note management app that allows users to create, store, and navigate call notes dynamically.
